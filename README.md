# Leadzai Backend Test

Created a class called Pagination.
In the botton, you can instantiate the object Pagination 
with different values passed into the constructor and call the method execute() to see the output.

To run the tests that cover the corner cases, run these commands in the terminal:

-> cd leadzai_test
-> python unit_test.py
